# Weather Dashboard

# Description

This is a simple weather dashboard using the OpenWeather One Call API. Users search for a city, and are presented with the day's weather (including an icon, temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index), as well as a five-day forecast. Searched cities are saved in local storage, which also populates a search history below the search bar.
